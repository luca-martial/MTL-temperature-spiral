# Montreal-Temperature-Spiral

The goal of this project was to create an animated spiral of Montreal's variation in temperature from 1872 to 2019.

Background: Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist, unveiled an animated visualization in 2017 which captivated the world. This visualization showed the deviations of the global average temperature from 1850 to 2017. It was reshared millions of times over Twitter and Facebook and a version of it was even shown at the opening ceremony for the Rio Olympics.

This animation was created with the help of an article on Dataquest.io written by Srini Kadamati.

Historical weather data was retrieved from Environment Canada's website. Recordings from the Montreal McGill Station (Dr. Penfield Street/Redpath Street) provided monthly weather data from 1872 to 1993 while recordings from the Montreal McTavish Station (McTavish Street/Dr. Penfield Street), just 700 meters away, provided daily weather data from 1994 to 2019. Combining data from both sources may constitute a source of error, but with the unavailability of continuous weather recordings from 1872 to 2019 from a single station, there appears to be no alternative solution.
